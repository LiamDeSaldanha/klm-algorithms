## 1. About <i><strong>klm-algorithms</strong></i>
<i><strong>klm-algorithms</strong></i> is a modular software tool for computing <strong>defeasible entailment</strong> and <strong>justification-based explanations</strong> within the <strong>Kraus–Lehmann–Magidor (KLM)</strong> framework for non-monotonic reasoning. The tool implements the three principal KLM inference operators, <strong>Rational Closure</strong>, <strong>Lexicographic Closure</strong>, <strong>Basic Relevant Closure</strong>, and <strong>Minimal Relevant Closure</strong>, together with multiple optimised algorithmic variants for each operator.

The system provides a unified environment for:
- Constructing and editing propositional defeasible knowledge bases
- Defining defeasible statements
- Computing defeasible consequences under different KLM inference strategies
- Generating minimal justification sets, explaining why each conclusion holds
- Comparing algorithmic behaviour across operators and datasets

In addition to operator-specific justification procedures, the tool includes a <strong>universal justification algorithm</strong> that extracts all justifications from any deciding knowledge base, regardless of the inference operator that generated it.

Designed for both researchers and practitioners, KLM-Algorithms supports reproducible experimentation, scalable testing on synthetic and benchmark datasets, and visual exploration of entailments and explanations. It aims to provide a practical, extensible platform for studying defeasible reasoning, evaluating reasoning algorithms, and developing explainable AI systems grounded in formal logic.

<strong>A Masters Degree in Computer Science with Distinction was awarded by the University of Cape Town for the Dissertation that produced this work.</strong>

## 2. Requirements
- Maven 4.0+
- Java 21+

<a name="compile"></a>
## 3. Compilation and Usage
There's a binary under `app/` folder which can be run without need for compilation. However, it still requires Java 21+. To run the binary run java -jar `app/klm-algorithms-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Compilation
```bash
mvn clean package
```
### Usage 
```bash
java -jar target/klm-algorithms-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
After running the above command, visit `http://localhost:8080/` on your web browser. Check the **syntax** before sending the queries.

### Live Deployment 
Alternately, you can just access the live web deployement at [https://klm-algorithms.fly.dev](https://klm-algorithms.fly.dev).
